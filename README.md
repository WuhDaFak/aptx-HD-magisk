# APTX for Android Oreo up to Android 10

A magisk module to add aptx(HD) on any device running android 8 or newer. Please keep in mind that I only tested the arm64 compatibility on Android 10 (LineageOS 17.1), so let me know on my xda thread if it works in the arm64 version of oreo&pie too.

## Requirements
- Android 8 and up
- Only tested on LineageOS based ROMs (should work on any other AOSP based rom)

## Compatibility
This module was tested on following devices:
- Samsung Galaxy S3 Neo
- Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300
- HTC One M8
- HTC One M7
- Nvidia Shield Tablet
- HTC One M9
